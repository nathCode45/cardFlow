CardFlow is an app that allows users to create and study flashcards. Users can create flashcards either through a rich text editor with both front/back and fill-in-the-blank options or by taking a picture of handwritten notes and masking out parts of the picture to occlude in the flashcard. Cards can be studied using a spaced repetition schedule based on user feedback given through a slider scale after each repetition. This creates a more personalized and efficient study experience.
